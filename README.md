OS CAD files for ROV Dragonfly (CCROV 2025 ROV build)

Adjustable ballast files are for an easily adjustable ballast system. The ballast cells are filled with metal shot (steel, lead, bismuth, tungsten). The cell caps snap on with a press fit. The covers slide in and stay in place with the bump that locks into the ballast holder. All parts are designed for 3D printing. Tolerances are for a Prusa MK4S and may require some tuning.
